<P> Here we can see that the bpm has been doubled, as doubling the bpm doesn't neccesarily change the tempo
  but it makes it relative to the player. Since the .wav file doesn't really have a feature  to differentiate the two instruments (vocals and keys),
  it ends up sounding jarring as some of notes create harmonic dissonance (notes with only a half step difference playing at the same time)
